Generate a lecture scribe intended to serve as authoritative exam-reference material for the assigned lecture. The scribe must enable a student to reliably revise the lecture using only this document.

Use strictly and exclusively the provided context, which consists of lecture slides/PDF and relevant textbook excerpts. Every statement, equation, definition, derivation, and example must be traceable to the provided context. Do not introduce any external knowledge, additional examples, interpretations, or simplifications.

The lecture scribe must faithfully reconstruct the lecture content and include the following components whenever they appear in the provided context:

• Definitions and notation exactly as presented  
• Assumptions, conditions, and constraints  
• Statements of theorems, results, or properties  
• Proofs or derivations reproduced in complete step-by-step form  
• Worked examples including all intermediate steps  
• Logical progression and dependencies between concepts  
• Mathematical expressions written clearly and accurately  

Maintain strict correctness and completeness. Do not omit intermediate steps in proofs, derivations, or example solutions if they appear in the lecture materials.

The scribe must follow a clear academic structure with well-organized sections and subsections that reflect the lecture’s conceptual flow. The document should be suitable for closed-notes exam preparation and must preserve formal technical language consistent with lecture material.

Do NOT include:

• New examples, exercises, or applications  
• Additional explanations, intuition, or elaborations not explicitly present in the context  
• Personal commentary, summaries, or creative rewording  
• Content outside the lecture or textbook material  
• Assumptions or reasoning that are not explicitly stated in the context  

Ensure the final output is precise, structured, complete, and fully aligned with the provided lecture and textbook content.
